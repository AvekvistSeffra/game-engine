# Some type of C++ game engine
Using SDL2. Just playing around for now. 

## Ideas
- I want to implement some kind of ECS. 
- Some easy way to create sprites. 
- A scene/room system. 

## If you want to test
Only set up for macOS right now. Install the SDL2 framework in /Library/Frameworks and have g++ readily available, it should work.
